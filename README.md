# City Finder

City Finder is a browser-based game created with React. The goal is to pinpoint the location of certain U.S. Cities on a blank map as accurately as possible.

## Standard Mode
Standard Mode is the original form of the game. There are ten rounds, and for each round you need to pinpoint the location of one city.
Click the map to guess, and click submit to submit your answer. The distance (in kilometers) between your guess and the actual location of the
city will be added to your Total Distance. Click next to move to the next round. Try to minimize your total distance!

Once you have completed ten rounds, you will be able to see a list of all of your guesses. You may click on the entries of the list to review
each individual guess, if you wish.
